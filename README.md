# Quiz-App-on-React

It's a full React app that can be used to get and create Quizes and Tests that are located in a Firebase database with authorisation and stuff

And I have a refactored version of the App which I have made with Redux - [check it out](https://github.com/gennady-bars/Quiz-App-on-React-with-Redux)
